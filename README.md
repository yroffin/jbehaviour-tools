jbehaviour-tools
================

jbehaviour-tools

behaviour-tools is not a fork, but it's based on the great idea of dan north : http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd
all is rewritten, and based on a antlr grammar.

this framework permit to parse and execute story with a jbehave approach but with some extention :
- json object on the fly creation and manipulation in the story (with jackson)
- velocity templating integration to manipulating all object created on the fly
