<h2>1. General</h2>

<p>A story look like this kind of presentation :</p>

<pre><code>...
#
# some comment ...
#
...
Feature: [some feature]
    ==&gt; some feature to implement with this story
In order to [test purpose]
    ==&gt; objectives of this story
As an [actor description]
    ==&gt; actor for this story
I want to [story purpose]
    ==&gt; purpose of this story
Register [reference]
    ==&gt; reference of this class during story running") with [classpath] ==&gt; class path, class path must be enclose by cote plugin
Declare  [reference]
    ==&gt; reference of this object during story running") as   [String|Json]
    ==&gt; type of this object") [classpath]
    ==&gt; class path, class path must be enclose by cote [json declaration] ==&gt; object declaration or value
Include  [story path]
    ==&gt; path where we can find this story, path must be enclose by cote")
...

Scenario: [scenario purpose]
    ==&gt; some scenario description
Given [some precondition]
    ==&gt; some precondition
And   [some other condition]
    ==&gt; some other precondition to initialize
When  [something hapen]
    ==&gt; declare an event reaction
And   [some other event]
    ==&gt; another declaration
Then  [some action]
    ==&gt; some feature to implement with this story
And   [some other action]
    ==&gt; some feature to implement with this story
...
</code></pre>

<h2>2. Feature</h2>

<p>A feature implement the story declaration, this feature can have a description to identify
the purpose of this story.</p>

<pre><code>Feature: Launch a story sample
In order to test this feature
As an explicit system actor
I want to verify this behaviour
...
</code></pre>

<h2>2. Register</h2>

<p>Each scenario will implement some steps, each step must be recognized by a declared class.
Class register consist to declare a class path associated to one global unique id, this global id will be use to correct ambiguity if necessary.</p>

<pre><code>...
Register sample with 'org.jbehaviour.plugins.SampleSteps' plugin
...
</code></pre>

<p>This declaration declare an internal global id 'sample' for the class <a href="https://github.com/yroffin/jbehaviour-tools/blob/v1.1a/jbehaviour-engine/src/test/java/org/jbehaviour/plugins/SampleSteps.java">org.jbehaviour.plugins.SampleSteps</a>
this class must be in classpath.</p>

<p><strong>Notice that</strong> override is working, so default extention can be overriden (SystemSteps etc ...).</p>

<h2>3. Declare</h2>

<p>Each scenario will implement some steps, each step can use local object (String, Class ...) ...</p>

<p>For a json declaration :</p>

<pre><code>...
Declare ref001 as Json 'org.jbehaviour.plugins.ComplexJsonBean'
{
"field1":"value1",
"field2":"value2",
"field3":1000
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>And for a String declaration :</p>

<pre><code>...
Declare ref002 as String "some string 002"
...
</code></pre>

<h2>3. Include</h2>

<p>A story can include an external story for :</p>

<ul>
<li>All Registered Class inclusion of this external story</li>
<li>All Declared Object inclusion of this external story</li>
<li>All Scenario inclusion of this external story</li>
</ul>

<p>A sample code could be :</p>

<pre><code>...
Include 'src/test/resources/files/sample.story'
...
</code></pre>
