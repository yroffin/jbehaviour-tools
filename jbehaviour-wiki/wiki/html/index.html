<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Main purpose of jbehaviour-tools is to simplify common developpment tools for
common users.</p>

<p>behaviour-tools is not a fork, but it's based on the great idea of dan north : <a href="http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd">http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd</a>
all is rewritten, and based on a antlr grammar.</p>

<p>This framework permit to parse and execute story with a jbehave approach but with some extention :</p>

<ul>
<li>json object on the fly creation and manipulation in the story (with jackson)</li>
<li>velocity templating integration to manipulating all object created on the fly in the story</li>
<li>storage during the story on object in session</li>
<li>include other story</li>
<li>registering annoted class at the begining of the story</li>
</ul>

<p>the purpose of this framework is to simplify, and make readable all story manipulated by a business analyst
and avoid to consider so much technical method for using testing tools :
- soapui
- ssh/scp/sftp/svn/git manipulation
- remote host manipulation (unix system)
- selenium suite
- and so on ...</p>
