Feature: Launch all story
  In order to test file inclusion
  As an explicit system actor
  I want to verify this inclusion capacity
  #
  # inclusion of a file include in this local story
  # all register, declare and scenario feature
  #
  Include 'src/test/resources/files/sample.story'
  Include 'src/test/resources/files/extended.story'
  Include 'src/test/resources/files/declare.story'
